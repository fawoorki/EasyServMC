# EasyServMC
## About the project
An old project of mine that helps you host "Minecraft" servers on your PC. Unfortunately, I never actually finished it, but Iâ€™m planning to do so when I have time. The whole purpose of the project was to learn the basics of Python and create simple GUIs. I also had trouble converting it to a .exe file, so it's not very user-friendly to run for now.

### Woopsie
Also, after looking at the code, I realized it's pretty poorly written (donâ€™t blame me, itâ€™s one of my first codes ðŸ™„). Iâ€™ll probably work on improving that as well.
